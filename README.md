## ES6 Promises

> The Promise object is used for deferred and asynchronous computations. A Promise represents an operation that hasn't completed yet, but is expected in the future.

Javascript's inherent asynchronisity is an incredibly powerful quality of the language; however, it can also prove frustrating when you explicitly want your program to block on some code. This happens often when we're waiting on a response back from an http call.

In this lesson, work with your students to go through each example. All the examples are listed in `main.js`; however, you can also change between branches. There are 8 branches named `step-#`.

### Setup

1. `npm install`
1. `npm test` or `jasmine`
